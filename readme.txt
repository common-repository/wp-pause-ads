This plugin allows you to create HTML/CSS/JS Code Snippets and to embed them anywhere in your posts, using a shortcode.

== Description ==

Every Snippet can have tags and a format (which are custom taxonomies) attached to it. On display, the plugin will search for snippets with the same tag and/or format, and display one of them acccordingly. If multiple snippets are available, one of them will be randomly choosed on every page refresh.

You can use this plugin for your ads, but also for any HTML/Javascript/CSS code you wish to display on multiple pages.


== Installation ==

1. Upload and unzip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add your ads via the admin panel
4. Place [wp_pause_ads keyword="my_key" format="my_format"] anywhere in your posts.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What will happen if I use a non-existing format/label ? =

The plugin won't display anything.

= Can I use the shortcode multiple times to show multiple snippets in the same post ? =

Sure.

= Can I de-activate a snippet without deleting it? =

Snippets are just like Wordpress posts. You can set their status to "Draft" if you don't want them to appear on your blog.
